we compared results obtained in classifying 11 different tumor classes through different approaches of ML. 
First we tested Hierarchical clustering and K-Means (unsupervised learning), then eight classification algorithms 
(supervised learning): K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression (LR), 
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayesian Classifier (NB), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forests (RF), 
Decision Trees (DT), and finally we applied Deep Neuronal Networks (DNN) such as fully connected neural networks 
and convolutional neural networks.
